## 7. How to run project

For example:  
```sh
npm run serve
open the browser ENTER 'http://localhost:8080/ '
```

You should see app running. store file acts like backend database or api connection & router file maps to different routing pages. This is initial project set up. Once the Shopping Cart component is complete you will have mini full blown application. However it won't work for payment mechanisim. You can add up whatever you like on top of this. Good luck. I am very busy when I get a chance I will finish shopping cart section as well.
